## Goals and credits

**ferencfarkas.org** is the official website of hungarian classical music
composer Ferenc Farkas. It is privately run by his son **Andràs** and
his family ("we" / "us" in the text), namely Françoise (his wife),
Istvàn and Izabella (their children).

This website aims to promote Farkas' musical work by providing all the
information in our possession. The rights to all multimedia content on
this website belong to their respective authors.

The [catalogue of works]({{< ref "work/_index.md" >}}) has been worked for
years organizing, documenting and categorizing all the manuscripts in our
possession. It used to be a single printable PDF file of 100+ pages and has
enabled lots of musicians and professionnals discovering Farkas' works.

The present website is an attempt to digitalize this catalogue, making it
easier to use and enrich it with multimedia content, especially music samples
and images.
