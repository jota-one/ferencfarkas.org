> Compared to the rich heritage of popular songs, the old dances and melodies, which have come down to > us through codex and tablature books, hold a much more modest place in our Hungarian music. 
> 
> It was in the 1940s that I first became interested in this music. I found it so fascinating that I 
> decided to revive it. Using the stylized harmony and counterpoint of the early Baroque period to 
> recreate a “provincial” Hungarian Baroque style, I composed a suite of dance for piano which was 
> published in 1952 under the name of Early Hungarian dances from the 17th century.
>
> In 1961, I orchestred these dances under the name Choreae hungaricae by adding other movements which 
> I gathered according to their sources: 4 dances from the Vietorisz codex, 5 dances from the Kajoni 
> codex and 6 dances from the Löcse tablature book.
