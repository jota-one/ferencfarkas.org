> In 1922 I had already used the popular melody of “Kömives Kelemen balladája” (The ballad of Kelemen 
> Kömives) in the first movement of my “Two pieces on Hungarian folk songs” for piano. In 1960, I took 
> up this old song comprising 14 verses on the same motif in the form of Lied that I orchestrated under 
> the name “Kömives Kelemen balladája”. In the accompaniment, I used only the notes of the melody, 
> increasing, decreasing or reversing them and, sometimes, condensing this material to achieve dramatic 
> climaxes.
>
> This ballad has a very dramatic subject dating of the 16. century:
>
> "There were masons, nine or twelve. They took upon themselves to erect a building - strong and 
> beautiful, like none there was before. And they worked day and night but whatever they constructed 
> collapsed.
>
> And it was so for three weeks - even three years. The head mason, Kelemen  Kömives, then learned that
> they needed to make a sacrifice: to offer the first woman who comes the next day, as atonement.
> 
> And the next morning Kelemen Kömives wife came, loving, with a good meal for her husband. And the 
> masons seized her, and they built her into the walls. And the walls stood from then on”.
