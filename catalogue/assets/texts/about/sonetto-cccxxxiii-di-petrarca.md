> I have been a member of the jury of the "Guido d'Arezzo" International Composition Competition on several occasions (the last 
> time I shared this honour with Luigi Dallapiccola and Goffredo Petrassi). My wife often accompanied me to these events in 
> Arezzo and I must confess that we very much enjoyed Petrarch's beautiful hometown.
>
> It is therefore no coincidence that, when my wife died in 1992, the first work I wrote and dedicated to her memory was based 
> on Petrarch's sonnet CCCXXXIII
