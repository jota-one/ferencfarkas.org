The tale relates the adventures of the beautiful **Suleika** who charms one after
another **the Cadi**, **the Mufti** and the **Grand Vizier**, until she
finally extracts from them the order to release her unjustly imprisoned husband.

A **carpenter** who has also fallen under the charms of the beauty is charged
with the construction of a cupboard with four compartments in which **Suleika**
traps her suitors one after another.

The suspense is at its peak when no one is on the stage anymore,
just a  magic cupboard singing with despair a four part male chorus melody:

__She's gone, the sweet enchantress, maybe that our desire was only a dream...
and now our dream is pursued by reality, our fate inside that closet is captivity!__

> I conducted the première of The Magic Cupboard in Cluj on 16 March 1943,
> and my opera met huge success.

In 1975, the Hungarian Television broadcasted a version of the work in one act.
