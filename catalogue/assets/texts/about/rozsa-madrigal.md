> In 1947 I was spending some time with the poet Sándor Weöres in Székesfehérvár. One afternoon he showed me his new composition
> entitled 'From the Songs of' Roses'. The ink had barely dried on his manuscript. Three stanzas from the cycle inspired me so much that I composed “Rózsa madrigal” the same evening. This work was subsequently translated into German, French and English.
