> The marriage of my son András with Françoise Viquerat, a young Swiss pianist, was celebrated on June 
> 23, 1973 in the charming little church of Tolochenaz (Switzerland). My son's father-in-law, who was a 
> pastor, blessed the newlyweds and the “Epithalamium” for organ that I had composed in honor of the 
> young couple resounded under the vaults of the church. 
>
> The score begins with a few bars of chords then appear two themes that hide the letters of the names 
> of the newlyweds, Françoise and András, recipients of the dedication, symbolizing their intertwined 
> destiny.

In 1978, Ferenc Farkas added a solo oboe to his work. The oboist Lajos Lenscés liked this little piece so much that in 2017 he adapted the organ accompaniment to a string orchestra.
