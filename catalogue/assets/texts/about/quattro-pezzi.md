> My son András, in his youth, played the double bass and it was for his 20th 
> birthday in 1965 that I composed this work. I replaced the initial piano 
> accompaniment with a wind quintet in 1966 at the request of the Budapest Wind 
> Quintet. It is in this version that this work became popular. 
>
> The rhythmic playing of the “Intrada” is followed by a “Scherzo” articulated at 2/3 
> battute to make it more varied and by a lyrical intermezzo entitled “Petit Poème”. 
> The 4th movement is a “Rondo” whose first verse is “fugato” and the 2nd verse, 
> “ostinato”. 
> 
> Another version also exists for cello and piano.
