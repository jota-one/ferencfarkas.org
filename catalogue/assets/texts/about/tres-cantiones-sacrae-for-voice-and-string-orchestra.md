> In my "Tres cantiones sacrae," I set three Latin liturgical texts to music.
>
> For "Paulus ad Corinthos de charitate Â», which I wrote in 1988, I took up Saint Paul's letter to the Corinthians, which speaks 
> of love. I am surprised that, to my knowledge, no one else has set this touching confession to music.
>
> The other two songs date from 1991: "Canticum Redemptorum," is a song of thanksgiving based on a text from the Prophet Isaiah 
> (Isaiah 12), and "Psalmus 67," is a psalm of praise.
