> In the spring of 1934, I went to the County of Somogy in order to collect melodies 
> sung and played by peasants and I wrote down in detail my memories of this stay in a 
> booklet which I entitled "Greetings to Somogy" (Somogy köszöntése).  
>
> The results of my research, which I handed over to the composer and ethnomusicologist 
> Lászlo Lajtha in the form of cylinder recordings and written notations, were lost 
> during the war. What remained was only what I had copied for myself.  
> 
> Later, I took up most of these melodies in various forms.
