> My « Vidróczki », composed in 1963, is what I would describe as a popular
> romantic opera: after Ede Poldoni's « The Carnival Wedding » and Dohnányi's
> « The Tenor » in the early twenties, there had been a gap in the history of
> this once popular genre which I wanted to fill.
> I wrote my work for the Szeged Open Air Festival, which attracts close to
> eight thousand spectators each year. It is a different audience to one for a
> chamber concert of Beethoven's C sharp minor  « String quartet ».
> To please the average concert-goer, it is necessary to provide a piece with a
> spectacle and easier listening. The opera relates the adventures and death of
> Vidróczki, a big-hearted bandit who lived in the nineteenth century in the
> Mátra Hills. I had particular pleasure setting to music a scene in which a
> marriage and a burial proceed simultaneously.
