> “My “Vidróczki”, composed in 1963, is what I would call a popular romantic opera. I choose this 
> musical genre because, since Ede Poldoni's "Farsangi lakodalma" and Dohnányi's "A Tenor" in the early 
> 1920s, there was a void in Hungary that I wanted to fill.
> 
> This work was intended for the Szeged Open Air Festival, which attracts nearly eight thousand 
> spectators each year. It is obvious that such an audience differs from one listening to Beethoven's 
> “String Quartet in C sharp minor” in a small concert hall. To appeal to this huge audience, the show 
> must be entertaining and the music pleasant.
>
> The opera relates the adventures and death of Vidróczki, a kind-hearted bandit who lived in the 19th 
> century in the Mátra Mountains. I had particular pleasure in setting to music a scene where a wedding 
> and a funeral take place simultaneously.
