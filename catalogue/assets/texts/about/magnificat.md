> The "Magnificat" and "Laus Beatae Margaritae" are dedicated to the Vrouwen Kleinhoor Orpheus and his conductor Albert Wissink. 
> This choir asked me for religious choral music for women's choir. After many works for mixed and men's choirs, this gave me 
> the opportunity to compose something for women's choir in this genre.
>
> In the Gospel of Luke, we read that the angel visits Mary and says, "You will bear a son, and he will be called Jesus." This 
> revelation also inspired me to set a Magnificat to music. I thought of the organ accompaniment as being most suitable. This 
> work was created in 1994.
