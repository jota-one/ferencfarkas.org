> "Cantus fractus" was composed to Hungarian Gregorian melodies. Using the Gregorian style of the late 
> Middle Ages, I adapted these 3 melodies for solo baritone, women's or children's choir accompanied by a 
> three-part guitar ensemble.
>
> This piece was commissioned by the Esztergom Guitar Festival in 1982.
