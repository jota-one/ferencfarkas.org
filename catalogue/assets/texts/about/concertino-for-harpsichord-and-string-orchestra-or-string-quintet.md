> After brief holiday, in 1947, I resumed the series of concerts with Erzsébet Török and the others in 
> the Hungarian province.
>
> During this tour, the desire came to me to compose a “Concertino for piano” that I could add to the 
> program of our concerts. Unfortunately, I never had the opportunity to play it myself, but it was 
> performed by other pianists on numerous occasions. 
> 
> Two years later, the conductor Ferenc Fricsay asked me to write a concerto for harpsichord for an 
> artist from Berlin, Sylvia Kind. The time available for me to write this new work was so short that I 
> decided to transcribe my “Concertino for piano” for the harpsichord. The symphony orchestra that 
> accompanied the original work was transformed into a string orchestra, more limpid and better suited 
> to the solo instrument.
