> My "Concertino for trumpet" is a new concerto for chamber orchestra after that for harp, for piano, 
> for Alpenhom and for oboe. 
>
> In the three traditional movements - fast, slow, fast - symmetries and recapitulations appear behind 
> the free melodic structure and recall the contours of sonata form.
