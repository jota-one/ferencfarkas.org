> Ferenc Farkas was 25 years old when he composed his ''Divertimento''. This work represents the fruit 
> of his two years of study in Rome and it is thanks to it that he won the Franz Liszt Prize in 1933. 
> It was premiered in Budapest the same year under the direction of ErnÃ¶ von Dohnanyi.
> 
> The transparent clarity of the instrumentation and the logic of the forms certainly owes much to the 
> Roman experience of its author. But with hindsight and comparing the "Divertimento" to the entire 
> work of Ferenc Farkas, we can already find in it all the characteristics and originality specific to 
> the artistic personality of the composer.

> The first two movements of the piece have a Mediterranean resonance thanks to their cheerful 
> lightness. The 3rd movement has many effects, as well as the "Intermezzo" preparing the final "Rondo".
