> Ferenc Farkas wrote about the origin of the "Passacaglia":  "In 1931, while I was still a student by Ottorino Respighi in Rome, 
> I began to compose a Partita in 4 movements for orchestra,  whose third movement should be a Passacaglia. From this work, I 
> only finished the Passacaglia and the Scherzo.  
>
> “In 1968, I took over the Passacaglia and transcribed it for organ without any modification, except the last 6 bars, I 
> partially changed. In the shape of an arch, the work is based on a theme that is repeated thirteen times. Piano initially it 
> evolves in crescendo to a climax in the 33rd bar, then falls gradually to a gently end. "
>
> We do not know when and for whom Ferenc Farkas wrote a version of the "Passacaglia" for 6 clarinets but it comes back again in 
> "Intrada, Passacaglia, Saltarello" for wind ensemble, that the composer dedicated in 1982 to Philharmonistes de Châteauroux and 
> to their conductor János Kömives.
