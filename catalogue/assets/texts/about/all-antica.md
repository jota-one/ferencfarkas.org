> In 1964, my friend János Liebner asked me to write him a concerto. He was an excellent cellist, who 
> also played the baryton. 
>
> This instrument, that enjoyed a certain vogue in the 18th century, is related to the viol family. It 
> is a kind of six-stringed cello but at the back of the wide neck there are still between seven and 
> nine free strings which can be plucked with the thumb of the left hand. This is what makes its 
> playing technique very difficult. Haydn composed more than a hundred and seventy works for the 
> baryton intended for his master, Prince Esterházy, who himself played the instrument with passion. 
> 
> By trying to exploit the softness of the sound and the many technical possibilities of this ancient 
> instrument, I realized  that my music had of itself adopted an antique style; thus, it was quite 
> natural for me to give my new work the title “All’antica”.
