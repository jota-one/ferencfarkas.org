> I have long been preoccupied with the idea of writing a string quartet. Quite 
> frankly, whenever I recalled for myself the tradition of this exquisite genre, I kept 
> on postponing composition. After the summits represented by the great series of 
> quartets (Beethoven's eighteen, Bartók's six works), and the individual masterpieces 
> (Debussy, Ravel, Berg) it takes considerable courage to attempt a new string quartet. 
> And yet how many take the plunge! The final impetus to write mine was given by a 
> commission from the Hungarian Radio.
>
> The first sketches were jotted down in 1970, but work of another kind prevented me 
> from completing the piece until the summer of 1972. The three movements are framed by 
> a brief ritornello, appearing before the movements and at the end of the last 
> movement, always in different forms and lengths, each according to the action of the 
> movements. This action which unfolds behind the formal scheme can only be 
> characterized by generalities since music "only expresses itself" (Stravinsky).

> The first movement is a succession of vehement, dramatic and lyrical elements, the 
> second is pondering, lyrical and vibrating, the third is like a "fleeting vision". 
> All three movements are interconnected. The construction of the first movement is: 
> A-B-C-D-A1-B1-C1-D1-A2,  the second: A—B—C—Ab, the third approximates the so-called 
> "bridge form": A—B—C—B—A. The musical material of the individual sections is not 
> rigidly separated but is interwoven with the material of other sections.
>
> Dodecaphony appears in twelve-tone rows and in the application of note-groups 
> consisting of twelve notes, always in a flexible manner, never like a school exercise 
> or dogmatically. I never relinquish any of my melodic, rhythmic and formal ideals.
