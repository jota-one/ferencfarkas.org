CONCERTINO RUSTICO


In 1976, at the request of my friend the hornist József Molnar, I wrote a “Petite suite alpestre” for solo Alphorn. My „Concertino rustico” for Alphorn and string orchestra followed in 1977. 

Using the limited possibilities of the instrument, the three movements of the work give the soloist the opportunity to show all his virtuosity. The music is tonal and diatonic. The form of the three movements is also traditional. The first movement is a sonatina, the second a Lied with trio, the last a rondo.

The “Concertino rustico” is played in many countries, in various ways.
