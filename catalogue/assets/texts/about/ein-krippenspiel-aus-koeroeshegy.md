> I wrote this Christmas cantata at the request of the Komitat Somogy Council. When I visited the still 
> unrenovated little church at Kőröshegy about ten years ago I had no idea that this beautiful Gothic 
> building would one day be the scene of the world premiere of my work “Ein Krippenspiel von Kőröshegy”. 
>
> This small cantata is structured around four pillars of solo organ followed by a cappella choir on Latin 
> words by Janus Pannonius. Between these four pillars I have interspersed movements, for choir or soloists 
> and instrumental ensemble, for which I used popular melodies and Hungarian Christmas carols from the 
> County of Somogy and Transylvania: songs of the shepherds, songs of the angels , songs of the wise men. A 
> narrator brings these different movements while telling the Nativity story. After a pastoral for the 
> organ, the choir intones “The Holy Night” to which 3 solists placed on the organ loft respond to create an 
> echo effect until the end of the work.
>
> I orchestrated my cantata for my son Andràs who conducted it in this version at Lausanne Cathedral.
