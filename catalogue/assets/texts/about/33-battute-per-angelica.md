> In 1995, Farkas met Italian flautist Angelica Celeghin during a concert at the Italian Cultural 
> Institute in Budapest. The artist celebrated her 33rd birthday that year and Farkas composed for her 
> a piece for solo flute of 33 bars which he entitled “33 battute per Angelica”. 
>
> Many pages could be written on its proportions, on the dialogue between high and low notes which 
> slowly dissolves in the first section, on the metamorphosis and gently oscillating return of the 
> initial melody. In this world of the infinitely small, every sound has a cosmic meaning, the noises 
> of the outside world have been reduced to silence. For the author, the interpreter or the analyst all 
> that remains is the beating of his own heart.
> 
> By getting closer and closer to the flute for almost a century, the master has come a long way and 
> the very essence of his art was revealed when he found himself - for the first and last time - alone 
> with the flute...
