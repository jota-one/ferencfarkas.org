> In 1993, I met the violinists Lore Schrettner and Albert Kocsis during the Festival "Musik hat keine Grenzen" in Knittelfeld. 
> The idea then came to me to compose for these two friends a work that they could perform together. 
>
> The "Aria e Rondo all'ungherese" was composed in 1994 and should have been created by my two friends in 1995 but Albert Kocsis 
> died suddenly shortly before the "premiere". The work was nevertheless presented at Knittelfeld in 1995 with Lore Schrettner 
> and Martin Schminke, accompanied by the "Louis Spohr Sinfonietta".
>
> The theme of "Aria e Rondo all ungherese" is a 18th century melody, the author of which is unknown. This why I chose a 
> classical style to write this work. The second theme - quasi trio - has the same origin. I used "quasi-neutral" material for 
> the different "couplets" of the Rondo, the most significant of which (meno mosso, bar 114) appears again at the end of the work 
> as an "epilogue".
