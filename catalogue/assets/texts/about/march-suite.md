> The « March Suite » was composed in December 1947 to celebrate the memory of the Hungarian revolution 
> and the struggle for independence of the years 1848-49 against Austrian domination.  
>
> In the 1940s Farkas was one of the first in Hungary to experiment with dodecaphonic music. But under 
> the Soviet pressure after the Second World War, everything that the great masters of the early 20th 
> century had created was labeled by the new communist regime as “modernist formalism” and condemned. 
> Musicians were obliged to adopt a new style of music which was « easy to understand and in a mood of 
> constant optimism ». Under penalty of being sanctioned Farkas also returned to this path. 
>
> The cheerfulness of the work is apparent from the first hearing. According to the composer’s analysis, 
> the first movement, in a small sonata form, is characterised by the sound of enthusiasm, the second 
> movement, in ternary form, is a lament for fallen heroes, the third movement (rondo) depicts a bustling 
> battle scene, with horn and trumpet calls.
