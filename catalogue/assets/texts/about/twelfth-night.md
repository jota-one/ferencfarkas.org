> In 1954 I was asked to compose incidental music to accompany Shakespeare's play "Twelft Night".
>
> The same year I took up 4 melodies from my incidental music which I assembled in the form of a cycle of
> songs for voice and piano, then for voice and harp.
>
> In 1964, I used the melody of “Come away” as a motif in the 2nd movement of my "Concertino all'antica" and I
> rewrote this melody for choir in 1995, which I dedicated it to my daughter-in-law Françoise.
