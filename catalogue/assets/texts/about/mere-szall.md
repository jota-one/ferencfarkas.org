> I was inspired by many poems by Jenö Dsida, the Transylvanian poet who died at an early age. One of them was “Cantata lirica”, 
> which provided the lyrics for one of my cantatas. 
>
> The music written in a simple, "quasi madrigal" style for the poem 'Merre szall' (Where is it flying) has a smooth lilt, which
> is only broken by the throbbing of the line “botladozom magam összesebezve” (I am faltering, getting wounds all over me).
