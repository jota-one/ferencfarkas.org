> Created in 1959, my “Sonatina no.3” for violin and piano could well also be called “Sonata” with 
> its first movement full of momentum. The 2nd movement, at a languid tempo, is a cantilena which 
> develops in a very singing and expressive manner, like an Aria. The 3rd movement has a rondo form 
> which indulges in good humor.
