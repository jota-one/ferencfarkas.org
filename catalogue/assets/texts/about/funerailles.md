> January 1970 began with the music for a film about the life of Franz Liszt,
> Szerelmi álmok (Dreams of Love). I hesitated a little to accept this new
> order because I had not only to write the musical accompaniment for the
> film but also adapt the music of Liszt.

> Liszt's works in their entirety and I don't like making such “patchworks”.
