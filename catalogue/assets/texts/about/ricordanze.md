> I composed my piece "Ricordanze" for clarinet and string trio in 1984. I wanted to 
> write a one-movement piece of chamber music in which the clarinet would have a 
> leading role.
> 
> I recommended it to my friend GyÃ¶rgy Marton, who presented the work with his ensemble 
> at the Trinitatis Church in Mannheim on November 23, 1985. This date is even more 
> memorable for me, because the city of Mannheim organized three concerts for my 80th 
> birthday.
