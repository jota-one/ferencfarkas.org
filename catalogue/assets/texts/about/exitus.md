> “Exitus” consists of following smaller parts: Preludio, Passacagia, Ripresa, Intermezzo, Toccatina, 
> Fuga. The piece is composed in my own free-form dodecaphonic way. 
>
> It was created in 1990 and received an award at the Concorso di composizione di Trieste. The aim of 
> the competition was for composers to write a work for the exit of the faithful after the end of mass, 
> which explains the title of the composition "Exitus".
