> After the Second World War, I could no longer continue composing twelve-tone works because the cultural policy of the time 
> (communism) forbade it. So I returned to myself. In fact, I didn't commit treason, because my works from the 1940s, the "Piano 
> Concertino" and the "March Suite", had been written in a more emotional, more lyrical manner. This is especially true of my 
> Symphony.

> It was the first time that I tackled this musical genre. In my Symphony, of neoclassical character but without any style 
> constraints, I have put on an explosion of strong emotions.

> At the Union of Musicians the new works were regularly discussed and my Symphony also came up for examination. With the 
> exception of my friend the composer Lajos Vass, every one of the participants made such disheartening comments that I lost all 
> enthusiasm. In my last movement in particular, I was criticized for not having found a sufficiently recognizable theme. Out of 
> weariness, I abandoned it in a drawer.

> The first movement (in memoriam 4. 4. 1945, the date of the Battle of Budapest) was published under the title "Symphonic 
> Overture" (Szimfonikus nyitany). The second movement remained as it was under the name "Elegia" and I reworked the third 
> movement which became my "Scherzo sinfonico". This "unfinished" symphony was my only attempt in this genre.
