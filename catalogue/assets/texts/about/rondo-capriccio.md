> I composed the first version of the “Rondo capriccio”, for violin and piano in 1957. Two years later I rewrote the piano 
> accompaniment for wind quintet and in 1979 rearranged a third version for violin and string orchestra. 
>
> The piece is full of effect and rewarding for violinists. In my own way I have made use of serial technique. The series begins 
> with a short introduction followed by different themes played by the violin. In the middle of this compact form – almost in the 
> way of a trio – I have added a very singable tune, which a critic thought was one of my prettiest melodies.
