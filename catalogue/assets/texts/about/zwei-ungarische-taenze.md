> In 1940 Hungary was not yet at war but it had already mobilized its army. In order to partly compensate for the people 
> conscripted because of the war, the teachers were assigned to various civilian services during their holidays. I was allotted 
> to the big market hall in Budapest where I had to sort out old documents. Fortunately my boss knew that I was a composer and 
> after a while he closed his eyes to the fact that I was doing something else during working time. It was during this period, in 
> a white coat, that I orchestrated the “Rhapsodia carpatiana” and the “Two Hungarian dances”.
>
> The themes of these works came from my music for short films which I wanted to rescue and make more durable. I arranged folk 
> music from Ruthenia - the Carpathian Ukrain - and also from Béla Bartók's unpublished collected material.
