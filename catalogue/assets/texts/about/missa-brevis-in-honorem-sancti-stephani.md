> My Dutch publisher, Ascolta Music Publishing, asked me to write a mass for men's choir. I then thought of 
> the countless composers who had already set this eternal text to music and, yet, I felt that I, too, would 
> still have a few ideas when composing a new work for men's choir. It was thus a continuation of my three 
> previous masses for mixed choir, hence its name "Missa quarta".
>
> This composition dates from 1994 and can be performed with organ or string orchestra. Written for my 
> grandson Istvan, it is dedicated to the Chant de Ville male choir of Estavayer-le-Lac. The Vrouwen 
> Kleinhoor Orpheus women's ensemble was interested in it, so I made a new version for women's choir.
