> When I was still a student, I read the poem “Az öröm illan” (The scent of joy) published in 1917 in the 
> first edition of a collection of poems by Arpád Tóth entitled “Lomha gályàn”. Years later, I still 
> remembered its opening lines: 
> 
>    The scent of Joy beckons him,
>    Her beautiful eyes still flash back…
>
> In 1962, this memory prompted me to pick up Toth's collection of poems, and as I looked through it, 
> I was captivated by the lines from “Tavaszi Holdtölte” (Spring Moonlight):
>
>    The blonde rays glide dancing,
>    The air is flooded with the gold of the hollow moon…
>
> Then I decided to include in the composition a third song "Ez a nap is" (This day too), these three 
> beautiful poems thus forming a cycle of lieder.
>
>    This day too, like the rest, past. It's over.
>    This evening too, like the rest, came. Peace…
