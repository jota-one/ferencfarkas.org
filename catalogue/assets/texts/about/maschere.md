> During my stay in Rome, after graduating from the Respighi master school, I came across a book which 
> was illustrated with paintings by Gino Severini. In 1983, the 100th anniversary of the painter's 
> birth gave me the opportunity to compose my "Maschere". 
>
> The three movements of the original version, "Maschere" for piano, give life to figures of "Commedia 
> dell'arte" : Colombina, Povera Pulcinella, Arlecchino. I tried in my music to show the different 
> individualities of the characters.

> The same year, I also wrote two other versions of my work by adding two movements : Il Capitano and 
> Pantalone. The first version for oboe, clarinet and bassoon is entitled “Mascarade”. I sent it to the 
> widow of the painter with the dedication "Omaggio a Gino Severini all' occasione del centenario di 
> sua nascita". Written for chamber orchestra, the second version also bears the name of "Maschere".
