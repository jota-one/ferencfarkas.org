> When the Communist Party took power in Budapest in 1948, Hungarians found themselves locked in a real and intellectual “iron 
> curtain”. Purges, arrests and executions multiplied. The art of the early 20th century was described by the new regime as 
> “modernist formalism” and condemned. The musicians were compelled to adopt a new style of music that was “easy to understand 
> and in a constantly upbeat mood”.
>
> I had been among the first in Hungary (1942) to use dodecaphony. But for fear of sanctions, I stopped using it and, in order to 
> support my family, I accepted many commissions for works based on popular themes. For my “Romanian folk dances”, of which I 
> composed the first version for violin and piano in 1950, I used melodies found in Bartók's collection.
> 
> For the flautist András Adorjan, I resumed my composition in 1988 by adapting the accompaniment for a string orchestra.
