> I spent my summers for over twenty years on the shores of Lake Balaton. During my excursions, I often visited the village of 
> Köröshegy and, every year, I never missed attending the concerts held in its beautiful old church. It was for this place with 
> its very special atmosphere that I composed my "Cantiones optimae".

In the 16th and 17th centuries, Hungary suffered of the Turkish occupation and the music composed at that time fell into oblivion. "Cantio optima" (Beautiful Song) refers to a genre specific to Hungarian literature and music of this period. These are poems intended to be sung, and only a few with their melody have survived.

1. « Bátoritás a halál ellen / Encouragement devant la mort (Courage in the face of death ) » : János Szepetneki, 1555
   
   My Lord, my God, here I am in front of You,
   Ready in everything to submit me to You,
   Ready to suffer and ready to die for You,
   Do not let me lose the faith I have in You.

   From this world I'm already detached,
   For this world is overwhelmed by his sins.
   This world is the reign of cruelty,
   Everything is vile and vain, yes, all is only wickedness.

   In the year thousand one hundred and fifty five has written,
   At the edge of Szamos River, János Szepetneki,
   This song for being ready to die, 
   To find Christ, peace and bliss.

> 2. « Könyörgés / Imploration » : Bálint Balassi (1554-1594)
   
   Forgive, my Lord, my youth errors,
   My vile treacheries, my ignominious acts.
   From felony erase the ugliness, please relieve my heart.

   Oh, my soul, turn towards your God who receives you,
   It is He who calls you, his home is beautiful.
   Put yourself under his wing for He is your Lord, He is your God, your Savior.

   No doubts anymore about my fate, I wander waiting of death.
   The devil spies on me, I am afflicted with my sins.
   I am weary and sad, I see the end coming and grace of the Holy God.
