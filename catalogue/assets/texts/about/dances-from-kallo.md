> " During my studies in Rome, I realized that I didn’t need to write unnecessarily complicated music 
>  when I could express myself fluently, simply and clearly in the neo-classical language.   
>
> My “Dances from Kálló”, composed in 1930, were premiered in Budapest the same year and performed 
> successfully thereafter. 
> 
> In 1950, Zoltán Kodály wrote his famous “Kállai kettős” to the same melodies. Out of respect for the 
> great master, I did not let this work play for decades.
> 
> On January 18, 1975, the “Dances from Kálló” were to be heard again when my son András conducted the 
> work as well as "Zwei ungarische Tänze” and the "Dance from Transylvania" during a recording on the 
> Hungarian Radio.
