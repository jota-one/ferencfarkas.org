> In 1982, I traveled to Hamburg, the birthplace of Brahms, and had the opportunity to admire his 
> statue. The city was preparing to celebrate the following year the 150th birthday of the famous 
> composer. This is where the idea of writing a work in his honor came to me. 
> 
> Taking up the spirit of the romantic Lied, I tried to associate the language of Brahms with my 
> own style. The form of the „Sonate romantique”, in four movements (allegro, scherzo, andante, 
> allegro), is a reference to Brahms as well as the theme of the third movement based on the 
> following notes: 
> b flat (B) - d (R) – a (A) – b natural (H) - e natural (M) - e flat (S). 
> In the 4th movement, bars 39 to 41, I faithfully took over the accompaniment of one of Brahms' 
> melodies.
>
> The first movement is presented in sonata form, the second movement borrows the form of the Lied 
> with trio, the third movement is a simple melody and the fourth movement a rondo.
