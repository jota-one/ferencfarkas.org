The ballet's première took place in the
[Budapest Opera House](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hungarian_State_Opera_House)
on 19 June 1949.

Farkas adapted his ballet music into a orchestral suite the same year,
which would be transcripted for wind orchestra by Tony Kurmann in 2014.

## The plot

{{% row %}}
{{% column %}}

The director of Debrecen College, **Professor Horváth**, intends his daughter,
**Rózsika**, to marry **Józsi**, the son of the town treasurer.
But she's in love with **Adám**, a poor student.

To make a joke, **Adám** removes a boot from a teacher asleep on a bench and
walks off by brandishing it. The teacher summons the students to find out who
is the author of the farce and **Józsi** denounces **Adám**, his rival.

Wanting to punish him, his classmates bring wine. **Józsi** drinks as
long as he rolls under the table. The drunken boy is transported in a comic
funeral march to the house of Rózsika's father.

Nothing can hinder the happiness of love anymore.
