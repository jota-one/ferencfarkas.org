> Having been very affected by the death of my wife Margit, I wanted to dedicate one last work to her and I 
> wrote this Requiem in her memory in 1992.
>
> The first bars imposed themselves on me in a dream : it was as if a voice dictated the music I had to 
> write. The continuation appeared to me very clearly, inspired by the traditional liturgical text in which 
> I found great strength. 
>
> I wanted to finish this work which is particularly dear to me with comforting words. This is why I put in 
> music the text of 'In Paradisum' which allowed me to find some inner peace and consolation.
