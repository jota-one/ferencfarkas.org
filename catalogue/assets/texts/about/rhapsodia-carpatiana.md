> In 1940 Hungary was not yet at war but it had already mobilized its army. In order to partly 
> compensate for the people conscripted because of the war, the teachers were assigned to various 
> civilian services during their holidays. I was allotted to the big market hall in Budapest where I 
> had to sort out old documents. Fortunately my boss knew that I was a composer and after a while he 
> closed his eyes to the fact that I was doing something else during working time. It was during this 
> period, in a white coat, that I orchestrated the “Rhapsodia carpatiana” and the “Two Hungarian 
> dances”.
