{{% column %}}

The story takes place in 1705 during the insurrection of
**[Ferenc Rákóczi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francis_II_R%C3%A1k%C3%B3czi)**,
prince of Transylvania, against Habsburgs domination.

Two brothers, **Palkó** and **Jankó**, have heard that
[**Ádám Balogh**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81d%C3%A1m_Balogh) and
his army of Kurucs are trying to liberate the fortress of
[Ersekújvár](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nov%C3%A9_Z%C3%A1mky).

In an inn, they meet **Márton Rosta** and his daughter **Éduska**.
**Palkó** falls madly in love with her. The four heroes, joining the Kuruc,
inform them that two Imperial armies are approaching Ersekújvár.
**Ádám Balogh** decides to attack the citadel.

The castle is taken and the two brothers are congratulated for their
courage in battle. The story ends with the marriage of **Palkó** and **Éduska**.

The music of the opera was reworked in the form of suites,
for orchestra or wind orchestra, lieder and choir.

**Csínom Palkó** has been the subject of a film (1973).
