> The set of “Basque songs” for female chorus was composed for the Chamber Choir of Budafok in 1986 and first performed at the 
> prestigious choral competition of Tolosa (Basque Provinces). It speaks for the popularity of the cycle that it was the 
> compulsory piece of the Tolosa competition some years later.  
>
> The close-to-nature simplicity of the folksong-inspired songs is fascinating. Rhythm plays an outstanding role in the cycle: 
> in the second and fifth movements the alto part imitates the typical Basque drum rhythm bringing about, interestingly enough, 
> more than once Hungarian folk rhythm associations in the listener.
