> It wasn't until the 1940s that I began to learn about dodecaphonic music. At the time, this technique 
> of composition was slowly beginning to spread in Hungary. I believe to have been the first Hungarian 
> composer to use it. The opportunity came, as was so often the case, in writing incidental music. 
>
> I composed my “Preludio e fuga” between 1944 and 1947. In the twelve-tone theme of the fugue, I did 
> not use Schoenberg's orthodox model but a softer form, more euphoric, with a rounder and more 
> attractive sonority - I am thinking of works by Luigi Dallapiccola  or “Le vin herbé” by Frank Martin 
> that I discovered at that time.
