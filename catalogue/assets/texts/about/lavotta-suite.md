> During my research into the field of Hungarian Baroque I discovered some fragments, airs and melodies 
> written by the violinist János Lavotta (1764–1820). These seemed so interesting that I thought to 
> create a work in the style of the Hungarian early Biedermeier period. 
>
> I am not the first contemporary composer to play with styles from earlier times. This pasticcio is 
> never ironic and contains no ‘wrong’ or ‘foreign’ tones. I have really tried to shape the simple but 
> original motifs in the way that Lavotta would have done, had he been of the level of composition of 
> his contemporary masters. We know that Lavotta studied but briefly in Vienna, and yet his minuets and 
> his German dances (having no upbeat) are rhythmically and melodically anchored in the Hungarian 
> musical tradition.
