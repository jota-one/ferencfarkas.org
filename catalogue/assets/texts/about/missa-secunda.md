> In 1962 I composed my first mass the “Missa in honorem Sancti Andreae” which seemed a little too difficult 
> for the choirs of that time. Since then the choral singing made a lot of progress.
>
>  I decided then, in 1964, to write a second mass, diatonic and easier to sing, the “Missa secunda in 
> honorem Sanctae Margaritae”. I dedicated it to my wife Margit for our 25th wedding anniversary. The 
> “Sanctus” was composed later and the “Credo” is not toned. 
> 
> First written for mixed choir and organ, I made in 1986 a second version for string orchestra. At the 
> request of one of my friends I adapted, in 1992, my "Missa secunda" for three-part women's choir and organ 
> or string orchestra.
