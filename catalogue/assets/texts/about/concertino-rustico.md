> ...In 1976, at the request of my friend the hornist József Molnar, 
> I wrote a "Petite suite alpestre" for Alphorn solo. My "Concertino rustico" 
> for Alphorn and string orchestra followed in 1977.
>
> Using the limited possibilities of the instrument, the three movements 
> of the work give the soloist the opportunity to show all his virtuosity. 
> The music is tonal and diatonic. The form of the three movements is also 
> traditional. The first movement is a sonatina, the second a Lied with trio, 
> the last one a rondo.
>
> The “Concertino rustico” is played in many countries, in various ways.
