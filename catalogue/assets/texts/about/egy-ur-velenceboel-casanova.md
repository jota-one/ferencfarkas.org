> Sándor Márai had written, in 1940, a novel, The Conversation of Bolzano (Vendégjáték Bolzanóban) of 
> which he later made a version for the theater. When I had it in my hands, I was so fascinated that 
> I put it to music in the form of an opera.
>
> The action takes place in 1756: Casanova, barely escaped from “the leads", the famous prison of 
> Venice, takes refuge in Bolzano where the news of his arrival sets the city in turmoil. Struggling 
> with the youthful and exalted Francesca and her old husband, the disturbing Count of Parma, Casanova 
> encounters the temptation of Love that he ends up defeating it in his own way.
>
> Due to the pressures which the new Communist regime exerted on him, Sándor Márai had been forced to 
> flee Hungary in 1948. At first, I feared that the Budapest Opera would not accept the libretto of an 
> exiled author, but András Mihály, the manager, comforted me in my project. I completed my piano 
> reduction in 1980.

> It seemed to me necessary that the author also give his approval. But Márai refused because he did 
> not want to benefit from a privilege while the Hungarian press was subject to restrictions. 
> Naturally, his veto forbade me to play my work in a public place. Looking for a solution, I had the 
> idea of perform it in a private club, only with singers and a piano. My hope of hearing my music was 
> definitely dashed when the minister, György Aczél, did not authorize the performance. My opera thus 
> remained in the drawer of my desk.
>
> Sándor Márai took his own life on 22 February 1989. His inheritors having lifted the prohibition on the distribution of his works in Hungary, I had the pleasure, 10 years after having composed it, of attending the première of my opera on 4 June 1991 at the Opera House in Budapest”.
