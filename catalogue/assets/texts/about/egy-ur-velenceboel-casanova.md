### The Writer : Sàndor Màrai

The writer of the libretto was born on 11th April 1900 at Kassa (Hungary) from an immigrant Sachs family. While attending universities in Germany, between 1919 and 1923, Sàndor Màrai was sending reports to Kassa and Prag’s newspapers. His years spent in Paris from 1923 and 1928 had a determining impact on his art. By the middle of the 30s he became an individual character of the prose, his novels, included “Guest Performance in Bolzano” became best-sellers of the time. He contributed paper articles, wrote books of travels, short novels, poems and dramas. In 1948, he emigrated and died in 1989 in San Diego. He was awarded the Kossuth-Prize posthumous by the Hungarian Republic in 1990.

### The Story of the Opera

The drama in verse is based on a novel, titled “Guest performance in Bolzano” published in 1940. The hero of the novel was shaped after a notorious adventurer of the 18th century, Giacomo Casanova but the story itself was an original one. The novel had turned out such a success that the writer got a commission by the National Theatre to adapt the work for the stage. The drama in verse itself appeared only in 1960 (Occidental Press, Washington, then Griff, München) and got to Ferenc Farkas at the end of the 70s. He did not have a libretto written. He took the original text instead just as Debussy, Richard Strauss, and Béla Bartók did. He shortened it, though. The opera was finished in 1980 but the writer was against a performance in a communist country. So the first performance took place only in 1991. The opera was attented a chamber opera with a 17-member orchestra, but it was extended for the Budapest Opera performance.

### The Music

The drama is written in 11 and 10 syllable lines with couplet rhymes. The text was not only an inspiring factor of the music, but was also followed closely and accurately by the music. The scene itself : a colourful town at carnival time swarming with masqueraders was reflected also by the music in which - among others - gigue, polonaise and siciliana are to be heard. However, the music is not an “Italian” one, but that of the Author, an original one, a blend of Hungarian folk song, Italian Neo-classicism, and dodecaphony. It is a dialog-opera, or a recitativo-opera, with “ariosi”, but without individual numbers. The reflexivity of the drama hit the composer’s fancy as well : e.g. the curtain-raiser and the after-piece played by Pierrot and Pierrette which are to say that the entire drama is nothing else but a joke - which can be taken seriously.
