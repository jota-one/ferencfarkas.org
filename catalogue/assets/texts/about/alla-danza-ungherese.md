> Composed in 1934 under the title "Hétfalusi boricza-tánc" (Boricza Dance of Hétfalu), this dance 
> is linked to a popular custom in the Hétfalu region (meaning "Seven Villages"): 
>
> a group of young men gather in mid-December to rehearse the "Boricza" dance and, on the 28th of 
> the month, dressed in traditional costumes, they travel through all the villages, from house to 
> house. Gathering at an inn, they share some of the provisions they have collected, then the young 
> women arrive and they spend many hours together celebrating and dancing.
