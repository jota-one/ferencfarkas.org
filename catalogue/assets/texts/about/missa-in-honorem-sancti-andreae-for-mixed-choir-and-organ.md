> It was in 1962 that I composed my first mass, at the instigation of my wife who pointed out to me that no 
> mass had yet appeared among my numerous works. 
>
> It was written somewhat “clandestinely” because, at that time, in communist Hungary, it was not 
> recommended to compose religious works. Not intended for any specific choir, I composed this mass very 
> freely, letting my emotions speak and I dedicated it to my son András.
> 
> It was performed for the first time in Balatonakarattya by the Piarist Gymnasium Choir, under the 
> direction of Lajos Maklari. The original version only had an accompanying organ which, for the occasion, 
> was replaced by a simple harmonium. In 1968, Laszlo Bucsi, choir director of the Franciscan Church of 
> Budapest, included my mass in his program and it was for this performance that I orchestrated it.
