> “Panegyricus”, I composed between 1971 and 1972 is a scenic play for vocal soloists, actors, 
> dancers, choir and orchestra. This work recounts the life of Janus Pannonius (1434-1472), the most 
> famous poet of the Hungarian Renaissance. Chancellor of the Hungarian King Matthias Corvinus then, 
> later, bishop of the city of Pécs, he wrote Latin poems praising love and the homeland.
>
> The  premiere took place on March 27, 1972 in Pécs. Although it was a great success, it was only 
> performed three times. As I had invested a lot in this work and in order not to lose this musical 
> material into which I had put so much energy, I used the instrumental parts to create an octet (like 
> that of Schubert) which was entitled " La cour du roi Matthias" and, with the choirs, I made an 
> oratorio, “Vita poetae”.
