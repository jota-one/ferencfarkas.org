> When I met Pál Fejős, in 1932, he was already a world-famous film director.
>
> At that time, I was sometimes hired as a pianist for recordings. I was here when Fejős recorded in 
> Budapest the music for his film “Marie, légende hongroise” (Tavaszi Zápor). Respighi was Fejős 
> favourite composer. He was told that a musician in the orchestra had studied with Respighi in Rome. 
> Fejős asked to see the “guy”; after I played him something he declared he would make his next film 
> with me : “The Verdict of Balaton” (Itél a Balaton).
>
> I composed for him the music for 7 films and 25 short movies he had realized during his expeditions 
> to Madagascar and the Seychelles islands. We became very good friends.
