> Composed in the first two months of 1990, "Minuti" consists of seven songs each of them barely one-minute long from the verses 
> of four Italian poets. The title thus refers simultaneously to the brevity of the songs and additionally – because of their 
> themes of sadness and passing – to the brevity of life.
