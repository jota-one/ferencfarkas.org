> My “Trio” for violin, cello and piano (1977-79) is the third work in a series of chamber music which 
> includes the “Sonata a due” (1961) for violin and cello, followed by the “String Quartet” (1970-72).
>
> In my “Trio” I wanted to emphasize continuity, each bar having to carry within it the possibility and 
> the need to give it a continuation. The piece is created as a novel is written, the varied repetition 
> of the different sections ensuring the form.

> In the first movement, the dramatic and lyrical parts follow one another alternately, in the second 
> movement (Cadenze) a theme, similar to a ritornello, separates the cadenzas of the three instruments, 
> played first separately then together. The third movement in which I used here and there a romantic 
> tone has a form of rondo.
