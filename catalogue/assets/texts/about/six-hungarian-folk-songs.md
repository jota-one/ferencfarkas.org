> After the war, the Ministry of Culture organized Democratic Cultural Days throughout the country 
> to promote Hungarian culture in which many personalities from the world of culture of the time 
> took part. I personally accompanied the great soprano Erzsébet Török at the piano. The post-war 
> period was difficult and sometimes we received payment in nature…
>
> …We had to give a concert in a village near to Békéstarhos but we were informed that there was no 
> piano there. Erzsébet Török then proposed adapting our program by including popular songs. This 
> is how I composed my “Six Hungarian folk songs” (Hat magyar népdal) using, to accompany them, 
> what I could dispose of : the musicologist József Ujfalussy who took part in the tour had a 
> recorder with him, and I found a violinist and a cellist from amongst the students at the 
> Békéstarhos School of Music.
