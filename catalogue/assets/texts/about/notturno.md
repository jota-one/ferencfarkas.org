> The “Notturno” for string trio is an early work. Begun in 1927 in Budapest, it received its final form in 1929, 
> in Vevey, Switzerland. Created in Budapest in 1930, on the occasion of my first concert as an author, it was 
> again performed shortly after in Rome and Zagreb. The manuscript was lost during the upheavals of the Second 
> World War and it was only 20 years later that it reappeared. 
>
> The two movements that make up the “Notturno” are in sonata form. The first, rather lyrical in tone, has no real 
> development. The second movement, light and cheerful, recreates the atmosphere of night music.
