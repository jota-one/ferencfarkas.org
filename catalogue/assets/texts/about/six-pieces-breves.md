> The “Six pieces brèves” were commissioned by Angelo Gilardino, the famous Italian guitarist in 1970.
>
> The first movement, "Preambolo", has the majestic tempo of an introductory piece. It is followed by 
> "Scène de ballet", light as a waltz. The "Danse guerrière" is a war dance with a powerful rhythm, the 
> fourth movement, "Grinzing", is a small ironic quotation from the Viennese waltz. After a short 
> "Intermezzo", the work ends with "Tivorno", which rhythm is typically Bulgarian.
