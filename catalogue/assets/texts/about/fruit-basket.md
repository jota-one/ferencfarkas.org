> I wrote the first melody of my "Fruit Basket" song cycle, "Altatódal" (Lullaby), for my son András's first birthday. The 
> humor, subtle emotionality, and occasional grotesque grimaces of Sándor Weöres's children's poems make them equally delightful 
> for adults. They inspired me to write more songs. Thus, the twelve songs of my cycle were created in rapid succession.

The twelve very short songs of "Fruit Basket" are entitled :

**1. Káspár** : 

He went off, he went off, 
Caspar, to a far away land, 
three letters of his fell behind, 
and became the village Cas, 
three letters of his made it there, 
and they became a pair, 
and gave birth to five children, 
two sons and two daughters, 
and the fifth a pope-pauper. 

**2. Ládika (The magic box)** :

There was a lovely casket 
an apple tree grew from it. 
On the apple tree 1 too 
picked melons in the afternoon. 
Sarika jumped upon it 
and there ended the casket.

**3. Marasztalás (Sunbeams)** : 

Don't take away 
with your two eyes 
the light of the sun. 
Don't go, stay on: 
Because the land 
will only darken. 

Branches won't sway, 
Swallows won't fly, 
farmhands won't sow com. 
Don't take away 
with your two eyes 
the light of the sun.

**4. Falusi reggel (Morning in the village)** : 

Striking - it's striking now –
the steeple in the morning! 
Time is painted white by the early calling cock-cry, 
a wild melody floating.
 
Little donkey, shout aloud, 
it's good to hear you honk! 
If you are drowned out by this cranky cackling cock-cry,
you'll forfeit your rank.

**5. Mondóka (Ditty)** : 

In the deep wood a violet patch,
hung over by a juniper branch.
Why must the branch hide? 
Come now, the world is wide! 
In the deep wood a violet patch. 

**6. A kőbéka (Stone-frog)** :

The stone-frog went slowly, 
the stone-frog went slowly. 
Midnight's fur was torn away 
the skin of dawn was stripped away 
The stone-frog went slowly. 

**7. Altatódal (Lullaby)** : 

Hush shush-hush rosehip, 
Hush hush cowslip ... 

On a moon-sheathed road, 
on a star-sheathed road, 
two dogs dawdle on the stony windy road.
 
Hush shush-hush rosehip, 
Hush hush cowslip ... 

The big-eared doggy asks you: 
Rosehip, rosehip, what's your game? 
The big-nosed doggy asks you: 
Cowslip, cowslip, what's your game? 

Rosehip lays, cowslip lays 
a blue pearl in a velvet casket, 
as long as slumber reigns it stays.
 
Hush shush-hush rosehip, 
Hush hush cowslip ... 

**8. Száncsengő (Sleigh-bells)** : 

Deep in the night ringing round - ching ding ding – sleigh-bells resound 
Sleigh-bells resound - ching ding ding – A silent drift on winter's wing. 

Two horses come throbbing through - clop clop clop - of eight horseshoes 
Eight horseshoes - clop clop clop – robbing sound from silence pouch. 

Mouldering forest of sound - ching ding ding – sleigh-bells resound 
Sleigh-bells resound - ching ding ding – A distant drift on winter's wing. 

**9. Békakirály (Frog-king)** : 

Beneath the reed, beneath the haze 
song rises from the water palace,
in the palace on green stone 
the Ung king sings – 

Outside the smooth meadow hears 
the song of Ung king coming near 
and towards the melody bend 
butterfly and grassblade.

**10. A tündér (The fairy)** : 

Plumicom, Plumicorn dancing, 
around her the angels are listening, 
bullfrog-armies play on pan-pipes 
cricket-armies on violins.
 
Plumicorn, Plumicom playing 
conjures up wings on a piglet, 
sits on her, promises her kisses, 
and flies her away as she giggles.

Plumicom, Plumicorn building, 
the walls of her castle of dawn mist, 
visitors fill up her hallways, 
daughters and sons of the dwarf-king. 

Plumicorn, Plumicorn sleeping,
resting on the autumn leaves, 
she slumbers in thickets of branches, 
and two snails watch over her dreams.

**11. Paprika Jancsi szerenádja (The clown serenade)** :

A weak breeze ripples on the lake, 
a pearlstring of lights billows. 
My sigh - orphan bird-fluff - escapes 
and rests on your sweet pillow. 
In my open breast the straw shivers: 
for you this clown does suffer.
 
Your beautiful eyes make the sky bleed, 
its many wounds are a starry road. 
A lock of your hair is enough for me: 
to bandage my many wounds. 
The sawdust spills, the straw falters: 
this clown will not be much longer. 

Your bowl the rose, your mirror the Moon,
and twilights burn on your lips. 
My delight into thick grief swoons, 
the song entreats and implores. 
And if my heart, my straw, ignites, 
for you this down will die.

**12. Déli felhők (Noon clouds)** : 

At the hill's root where the rabbits run 
and the foxes dig a burrow: 
in the summer light in the sunshine 
Katóka watches the c1ouds. 

A green grassblade between her lips 
her chin rests in her palm ... 
and drowsily she wonders at 
the wandering cloudlands. 

There King Mog swims up ahead 
with his two pronged beak, 
and his crown above his head 
poised like a cream cake. 

There behind him runs the fool 
grinning from ear to ear - 
a grey snake stretches to the sky 
from his hunched rear. 

On a broken-down trolley 
travels a shorn bear, 
and the princess Berryblood 
is tearing out her hair. 

Behind them on a hundred wheels 
rolls a gaudy house: 
inside the lady of the circus
 is putting on her c1othes. 

Her many clothes and all her jewels 
she would swap happily 
to run around for just a week 
down on the summer fields.
