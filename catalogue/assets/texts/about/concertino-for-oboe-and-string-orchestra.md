> The “Concertino for oboe” and strings was composed in 1983 for the outstanding Swiss oboist Jean-Paul 
> Goy. 
>
> It recalls the Baroque and classic traditions not only in its sequence of movements - 
> Allegro-Andante-Allegro - but also in spirit. It is called a concertino not just accidentally, but to 
> suggest - with its miniature dimensions and the exceptional refinement of the parts – a marked 
> diversion from the Romantic style.
> 
> The first movement (Allegro) is built on the alternation of two musical features, the four 
> recurrences of the fast beginning framing the slow parts. As against this asymmetrical rhythmic 
> pattern, the second movement (Andante, Choral varié) suggests ordered regularity. The oboe plays a 
> long cadence in the virtuoso final movement, enlivened by its dance rhythm, and then a short return 
> of the material of the beginning rounds off the composition.
