> “Jelky András” is a suite written to commission, around the end of 1973 and January 1974, for the town of Baja in southern 
> Hungary. As a child I spent several summer holidays with my grandparents in Baja, where I read the incredible but true story of 
> the local figure András Jelky (1738-83).
>
> Jelky set out as a journeyman in Bavaria but in Holland he was conscripted into the army. On the way to India his ship was 
> shipwrecked. Returning from South America he was kidnapped by pirates and sold as a slave and after his escape he was a soldier 
> in China and Indonesia wehre he was captured by cannibals. Finally he became a rich plantation owner in Java, and travelled as 
> Indonesian diplomat in Oceania and Japan.

> I set Jelky's adventures in music as if the protagonist himself were the narrator: the music is Hungarian, it is merely adorned 
> with oriental and exotic colouring. The string ensemble is supplemented with a piano. As well as traditional sounds, the piece 
> contains many special effects: the musicians strike the body of their instrument with their bow, or the strings with their 
> palms. At other times a timpani stick is used to strike the lower strings of the piano, or the pianist has to hit the lid of 
> the keyboard with the palms of his hands.  
>
> The piece begins with the start of the intrepid young man’ journey followed by a storm at sea. Then come the musical portraits 
> of Ali Hussein in Algeria, the greedy and cruel mandarin Fu Kong, Kwanga, the young girl from Ceylon who saved his life, and of 
> Ramayun the solitary fakir. The last movement picks up the theme from the beginning.
